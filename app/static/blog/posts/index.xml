      <description>Generating summary statistics is a common task in research and often requires iterative refinements. In this post we will demonstrate how to conveniently generate a Table 1 used for research papers in an automated fashion. We will be using public data from a clinical trial by Vickers et al. (2004) which was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on the use of acupuncture as a therapy for chronic headache. The PDF is available for download for free at the BMJ website (link).</description>
