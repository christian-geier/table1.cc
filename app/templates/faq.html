<h5>Q: What is the purpose of table1.cc?</h5>
<h5>A: Research papers in clinical trials or case-control studies usually include a <em>"Table 1"</em> to summarize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_statistics">population statistics</a>.
To minimize error, optimize efficiency and enhance reproducibility, automation of this task is desirable. Currently available software packages for <a href="https://github.com/kaz-yos/tableone" data-toggle="tooltip" title="A powerful statistical programming language">R</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tompollard/tableone"  data-toggle="tooltip" title="A programming language popular in life sciences">Python</a> provide part of the solution
but their reliance on programming syntax limits their widespread adoption.
